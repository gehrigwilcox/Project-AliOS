What if the memory table is stored by memory address. i.e.

  Memory address header n = Memory Table offset + n * headerSize

  Then the memory table is sorted by memory address

  We then have each header hold information about if it is reserved or not

  Then, we have the header hold an additional one of three values:

    1. If it is the first header for a memory block, hold information about the
        size of the block

    2. If it is the last header for a memory block, hold the pointer to the next
        largest memory block

    3. Any other header is left blank


What if the first header held a pointer to itself (indicating it is the first header in the block),
      if the block is free, and the size of the block.
  And the last header holds a pointer to the first header and a pointer to the next memory block and another value (To Be Determined)


  This way, I can locate memory blocks of a specific size, and I can de-fragment
    memory when it is freed
