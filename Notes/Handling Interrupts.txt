Handling Interrupts:

  Processor stops execution and jumps to Vector Table to figure out where to go

  The entry that is read from the Vector Table is determined by HCR_EL2 and SCR_EL3
    These registers determine where the interrupt should be handled

  Processor then reads the Interrupt Acknowledge Register to get the Interrupt ID
    (this also causes the GIC to know that we are currently working on the Interrupt)

  Once finished handling the interrupt, the same Interrupt ID that was read from the Interrupt Acknowledge Register
    will be written to the End of Interrupt register in the CPU Interface Block indicating the end of interrupt processing

    Interrupt ID 1023 means that there are no more interrupts to be handled
