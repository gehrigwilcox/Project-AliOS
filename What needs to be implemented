What needs to be implemented:

  Interrupt Vectors
  Switching Processes:
    Save current processor state:
      Where does it get saved to?
        It could be saved into the process struct
    Find next process to run
    Restore that processor state
    Set timer interrupt
  Kernel Translation Table
  Used Memory Table:
    Keep track of used and un-used memory blocks
